# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Car Price Prediction** system that estimates the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. The model is built using Machine Learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine Learning model training for price prediction
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- User interface for input and predictions

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Framework:** Flask / Streamlit (if applicable)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/komalpreetkaurr/CarPrice1_Predication.git
   cd CarPrice1_Predication
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   python app.py  # Flask
   streamlit run app.py  # Streamlit
   ```

## Usage
1. Input car details like brand, year, fuel type, mileage, etc.
2. Click on the **Predict** button.
3. Get the estimated price of the car.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of various car attributes and their corresponding prices. Data sources include Kaggle, web scraping, or pre-existing datasets.

## Model Training
- Data is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.
- Features are selected based on correlation analysis.
- Machine Learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost are trained and evaluated.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed for optimization.

## Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model as a web service (e.g., using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit)
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms
- Add a user-friendly UI
- Include real-time price updates
